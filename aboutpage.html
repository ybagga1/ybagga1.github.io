        I'm an aspiring video game designer, currently a student at the University of Florida. My major is computer science and I'm a junior. Here's a little bit more about me: 
        <br></br>
        <h2> Career Vision </h2>
        I have a strong passion for Video Games and Android App Development. As a current Computer Science student, I hop to obtain an internship in this field that will provide me with first hand work experience and enable me to mature as a person.

        <h2> Background </h2>
        Born in India, I've travelled a lot: first moving to Canada, then Singapore and then eventually settling in Miami when I started highschool. I believe because of the different cultures I have been exposed to, I have a unique perspective on things we take for granted here in the USA: everyone has things that are important to them.
